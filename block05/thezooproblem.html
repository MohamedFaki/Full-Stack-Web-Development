                    <p>As a zookeeper, it is important to provide Kodiak bears with large enclosures with plenty of
                        space to
                        exercise and a large water source
                        to swim and play in. We give the bears a variety of toys, puzzle feeders, new scents, and more,
                        to
                        keep them mentally stimulated. A varied diet is key for Kodiak bears, and they should receive a
                        number of different fruits, vegetables, and protein sources.

                    <p>Polar bears need at least 1 acre of open space per bear and large, deep, non-chlorinated
                        saltwater
                        pools. They have low protein requirements and maintaining bears on lower protein diets is
                        critical
                        to support long-term kidney health. Positive reinforcement training is used to train polar bears
                        and
                        many other animals in several behaviors that help with medical care. <a

                    <p>Frankie need regular hoof trims which are essential for their health. Zookeepers teach giraffes a
                        series of small behaviors before any actual hoof care can occur. The first step is to get each
                        giraffe to recognize a “target” and touch it with their nose, which is then reinforced until the
                        task is mastered. <a href="https://animals.net/giraffe/">Click for more detailed care</a></p>

                    <p>In a zoological setting the primary care component of these reptiles is a water source. It should
                        be
                        deep enough for the animal to submerge fully, and they should have plenty of room to grow into
                        the
                        enclosure. <a href="">https://animals.net/american-alligator/</a>Click here for more detailed

                    <p>Providing food is easy, as these creatures will prey on a wide variety of species in the wild.
                        They
                        can be fed fish, mice, rats, rabbits, chickens, and more. Some zoological institutions also
                        train
                        their alligators, and other crocodilians, using positive reinforcement. One of the many things
                        trained are stations, where the animals each move to their own spot to be fed. <a

                    <p>People keep these large reptiles in both zoos and farms. For the Chinese species in particular,
                        captive breeding programs allow researchers to maintain a population to reintroduce into the
                        wild.
                        Animals in zoos also help educate the public about the misconceptions associated with these
                        reptiles. <a href="https://animals.net/alligator/"> Click for more detailed care</a></p>
